# Ray casting based maze explorer
Personal project exploring the concept of ray casting.
## Build instructions
The project relies on SFML (for user input and window handling). If it can't be found locally by cmake, it will be downloaded from github and compiled.
### Windows
```
git clone https://github.com/GustavoFrittole/RayCastingProject.git
```
```
cd RayCastingProject
```
```
cmake -S . -B ./build
```
```
cmake --build ./build
```
```
./build/bin/demo.exe
```
### Linux 
When building on linux having the SFML dependency installed in advance might be more practical. For Debian is:
```
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```
Regarding SFML dependencies, this project's workflow file [build-ubuntu](https://github.com/GustavoFrittole/RayCastingProject/blob/652de14edd2ba82c59bac9e2bb2f2771dd5f1e0c/.github/workflows/test-builds.yml) can serve as example. More info on the [sfml guide](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/start-cmake.php).


## Features
Pseudo 3d environment generated via ray casting that allows to explore a maze (generation displayed at launch) or a custom map. 
- in-game map and mini map;
- calculation and display of shortest path to goal in generated mazes;
- switch between euclidean distance (curvilinear perspective) and projection to camera plain (linear perspective);
- customizable parameters (in `config.json`);
- custom textures for walls, floor, ceiling and sky;
- custom billboard sprite rendering in both perspective modes.
- scriptable entities
Note: distance based shading of horizontal planes (ceiling/floor) and sky are only available in linear perspective mode.

## Usage
Various variables are imported from the json file `config.json` that can be found in the asset folder, usage explained in the next section. Scriptable entities (includes player, static sprites and active entities) can be created and added as shown in `demo.cpp` and `demoEntities.hpp`.
The maze is generated using a [randomized DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Randomized_depth-first_search) algorithm, and the process of creation is displayed at game start.

### `assets/config.json` variables
- gameCamera: field of view in degrees, rays max length, ray precision;
- gameMap: width, height, option to generate a maze with given dimensions, file form where to load a rectangular map of given (or less) dimensions;
- screenStats: scale factor for the minimap (3 means that the center of the minimap will be at 1/3 of window height, right alignment) and scale factor for the wall height (basically the vertical fov);
- controls: mouse speed and movement speed;
- font: font used for the simple text ui;
- textures: file paths for all textures;
- sprites: a list of pairs of an id (int) and a path(string) from where the sprite will be loaded.

Note: ~~a sprite size multiplier,~~ an option for using flat colors instead of textures ~~and the possibility of using the same texture for multiple sprites~~ are, as of now, missing features. Ray precision has no effect on the DDA algorithm that is currently in use.

## Controls
- Built in:
   - `ESC` to pause and view map, 
   - `tab` to view full screen map without pausing,
   - `e` to calculate shortest path (will be displayed in full screen map, as of now not implemented for custom maps),
   - `space` to toggle camera plane on and off,
   - `R` to toggle sky on and off (only linear perspective).
- Available for scripting:
   - WASD affects cached values for frontal and lateral movement,
   - move movement or `<` `>` to turn left and right,
   - mouse left click or `q` is labeled as "leftTrigger" action,
   - mouse right click or `e` is labeled as "rightTrigger" action.

Note: Controls available for scripting are only exposed by the game handler; a possible implementation is shown in the demo project. The game starts paused. Press `ESC` to gain control.

## Known issues
- mouse speed lowers as the frame rate increases (whilst arrows rotation behaves correctly);
- ~~drawing sprites has a big impact on frame rate (multi threading not yet implemented in sprite drawing);~~

## Resources
 - Textures:
    - textures: edited DALL·E 3 and FLUX.1 schnell generated images;
    - sprite textures: original
 - Linear perspective:
