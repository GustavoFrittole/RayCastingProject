# Ray casting based maze explorer
Personal project exploring the concept of ray casting.
## Build instructions
The project relies on SFML (for user input and window handling). If it can't be found locally by cmake, it will be downloaded from github and compiled.
### Windows
```
git clone https://github.com/GustavoFrittole/RayCastingProject.git
cd RayCastingProject
```
```
cmake -DSFML_BUILD_NETWORK=false -DSFML_BUILD_AUDIO=false -S . -B ./build
```
```
cmake --build ./build
```
```
./build/bin/main.exe
```
### Linux 
Same as above, but when building on linux having the SFML dependency installed in advance might be more practical. For Debian is:
```
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```
Regarding SFML dependencies check this project's workflow file [build-ubuntu](https://github.com/GustavoFrittole/RayCastingProject/blob/652de14edd2ba82c59bac9e2bb2f2771dd5f1e0c/.github/workflows/test-builds.yml) or the [sfml guide](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/start-cmake.php).


## Features
Pseudo 3d environment generated via ray casting in which the user can explore a maze (generation displayed at launch) or a custom map. 
- in-game map and mini map;
- calculation and display of shortest path to goal in generated mazes;
- real time switch of distance measuring: euclidean distance (curvilinear perspective) or projection to camera plain (linear perspective);
- customizable parameters (in `config.json`);
- custom textures for walls, floor, ceiling and sky;
- custom billboard sprite rendering in both perspective modes.
Note: distance based shading of horizontal planes (ceiling/floor) and sky are only available in linear perspective mode.

## Usage
Various variables are imported from the json file `config.json` that can be found in the asset folder. Amongst other options, the user can choose to load their own map by turning "gameMap" -> "generated" to false and specifying a file path, can modify the map (that must retain rectangular shape and dimensions according to what stated in the config file) and change textures. If the map is generated, there's no need to provide a map file.
The map is generated as a maze using a [randomized DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Randomized_depth-first_search) algorithm, and the process of creation is displayed at game start.

### `assets/config.json` variables
- playerTransform: initial position and facing direction;
- gameCamera: field of view in degrees, rays max length, ray precision;
- gameMap: width, height, option to generate a maze with given dimensions, file form where to load a rectangular map of given (or less) dimensions;
- screenStats: scale of the minimap (3 means that the center of the m.m. will be at 1/3 of window height, right align), multiplier of the wall height;
- controls: mouse speed and movement speed;
- textures: file paths for all textures (alpha );
- sprite number: number of sprites that follow below;
- sprite<number>: texture file path, position in map; <number> starts from 0 and grows by one in each following sprite (0, 1 , 2 ...).

Note: a sprite size multiplier, an option for using flat colors instead of textures and the possibility of using the same texture for multiple sprites are, as of now, missing features. Ray precision has no effect on the DDA algorithm that is currently in use.

## Controls
- WASD to move,
- mouse left and right or `<` `>` to turn left and right,
- `ESC` to pause and view map, 
- `tab` to view full screen map without pausing,
- `e` to calculate shortest path (will be displayed in full screen map, as of now not implemented for custom maps),
- `space` to toggle camera plane on and off,
- `R` to toggle sky on and off (only linear perspective).

Note: the game starts paused. Press `ESC` to gain control

## Known issues
- mouse speed lowers as the frame rate increases (whilst arrows rotation behaves correctly);
- drawing sprites has a big impact on frame rate (multi threading not yet implemented in sprite drawing);
### Structural issues
- GameGraphics is bloated, this makes reusing code harder;
- Treating Core and Graphics as separate modules instead of layers would help decoupling.
